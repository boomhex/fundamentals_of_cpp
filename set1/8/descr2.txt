The reason why the ladt 2 inputs(20 & 16) give the same output is
because with 20 you keep the first 20 bits and zero the last 12 bits.
This is already enough to make it 129.125.0.0, since 3 is 00000011.
With 16 the program zeros the last 16 bits, which is more but it 
is already zero so the output is the same
