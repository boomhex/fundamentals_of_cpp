- Escape sequences are special characters that you cannot type normally like tabs or newlines.
- These are the standard ones defined by c++:
Escape sequences	Meaning
\n 					newline
\t 					tab
\' 					single quote
\b 					backspace
\" 					double quote
\\ 					backslash
\v 					vertical tab
\0 					null value
\xhh 				hexidecimal value (replace hh with value)
\a 					'audible bell', some sound on my laptop
\? 					question mark
\f 					form feed
\nnn 				octal value (replace nn with value)
\r 					carriage return

- If another unrecognized character is used as an escape sequence i.e. using a
backslash in the string, it is treated as a normal character. So if my cout
statement is:
std::cout << "We\qare Timo and Ruben.\n"
The output will generate:
Weqare Timo and Ruben
