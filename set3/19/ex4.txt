It is appropriate to use a const reference to a std::string parameter when
a function does not need to modify the std::string object, and you do not
want to make a more memory expensive copy of the string.

In the code example this is illustrated because the function does not need
to copy the whole string in order to display it. It can do perfectly fine,
and is more efficient in handling large texts.
