It is appropriate to define a std::string parameter when a function needs
to use string type parameters, and their built-in member functions, that
are in the std::string class.

In the code example this is illustrated because the function takes a
std::string type parameter as an input, and uses a built in member
function in the for loop to loop through the characters in the sentence.
