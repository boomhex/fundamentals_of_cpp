It is not appropriate to define a const reference to an int-type parameter
because an int is a built-in type. Handling the actual type is faster than
handling a built-in type. So that is therefore the preferred alternative.

In the code example this is illustrated where one function shows the non-
preferred way and one shows the preferred implementation of defining and
int-type parameter.
