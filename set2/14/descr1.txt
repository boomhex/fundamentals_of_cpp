This program computes the square root of a user-provided 
positive number using Newtonâ€™s iterative method.

It starts with an initial guess (x0 = 1) and repeatedly updates 
the estimate (x1) with the given formula

until the estimate stabilizes (x0 == x1). During each step, 
it prints the iteration number, the current estimates, and their squares.
When the loop ends, it displays the final approximation of the square root.
