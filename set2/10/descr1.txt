This program reads a full line of text from the user and removes any leading
 or trailing blanks (spaces or tabs). It does this by finding the first and
  last non-blank characters in the string. The cleaned-up text is 
  then displayed between a backquote (`) at the start 
  and a single quote (â€™) at the end. This way, 
  only the meaningful content of the input is shown without 
  surrounding whitespace.
