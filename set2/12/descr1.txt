This program checks if a given number is divisible by 3. 
It does so by summing the digits of the number repeatedly until 
only a single digit remains. If that final digit is 3, 6, or 9, 
the number is divisible by 3; otherwise, it is not. The program works on 
very large numbers by treating the input as a string 
instead of relying on numeric types.
